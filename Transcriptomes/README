Filtration Steps:
1. Longest isoform was obtained with Trinity/util/misc/get_longest_isoform_seq_per_trinity_gene.pl
2. This assembly was blasted against a Master Coral database using blastn (can be found at https://zenodo.org/record/7838980
3. Reads with less than 95% pident and shorter than 150 bp were filtered out
4. cdbfasta on the longest isoform and then the list of filtered contigs were concatenated to this .cidx file using cdbyank
5. TransDecoder.LongOrfs to identify longest isoform
6. TransDecoder.Predict to produce predicted proteome
7. cd-hit to remove similar sequences from predicted proteome
8. Sequence names grabbed from this proteome and extracted from the longest isoform fasta file from step 1
