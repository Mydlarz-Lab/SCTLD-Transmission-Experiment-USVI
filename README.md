## This repository contains 4 directories with the associated R-markdown analysis code:
  1. DEG_analysis_coral
  2. DEG_analysis_symbiont
  3. EVE_analysis_coral
  4. EVE_analysis_symbiont
## The directory named "salmon" contains the output from the transcript quantifying program, Salmon, for each coral species and symbiont genus, as well as necessary input files for Tximport

  
  Within each directory, you will find the associated R markdown code and necessary input files.
  I hope to make these analyses as clear and reproducible as possible, so if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.
