Any questions, email kelsey.beavers@mavs.uta.edu

## This repository contains 4 directories with the associated R-markdown analysis code:
  1. Coral DEG Analysis
  2. Symbiont DEG Analysis
  3. Coral EVE Analysis
  4. Symbiont EVE Analysis
  
I have also included any and all Command Line code used to filter, assemble, quantify and annotate the RNAseq reads in "Command_Line_Code.Rmd"

  I hope to make these analyses as clear and reproducible as possible, so if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.
