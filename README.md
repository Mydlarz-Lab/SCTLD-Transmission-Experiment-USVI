## This repository contains 4 directories, each with the associated R-markdown analysis code:
  1. DEG_analysis_coral
  2. DEG_analysis_symbiont
  3. EVE_analysis_coral
  4. EVE_analysis_symbiont
  
  Within each directory, you will find the associated R markdown code and necessary input files.
  All other necessary input files are in the salmon directory.
  I hope to make these analyses as clear and reproducible as possible, so if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.
