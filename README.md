## This repository contains 6 Rmarkdown files:
  1. Command_Line_Code - code used to filter reads, assemble and annotate transcriptomes, and quantify transcripts
  2. Coral DEG and Homolog Analysis - code used to quantify DEGs in each coral species and identify immune/ECM homologs with significant differential expression between disease states
  3. Coral Orthogroup Analysis - code used to identify immune/ECM orthogroups with significant differential expression between disease states
  4. Symbiont DEG Analysis - code used to quantify DEGs in each symbiont genera
  5. Coral EVE Analysis - code used to for analyses of highly variable and lineage-specific single-copy coral orthologs
  6. Symbiont EVE Analysis - code used to for analyses of highly variable and lineage-specific single-copy symbiont orthologs
  

  
## Also included in this repository is the "MasterCoral.fasta" file used in the "Command_Line_Code" to generate coral-only reference transcriptomes.
  
  I hope to make these analyses as clear and reproducible as possible, so if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.
