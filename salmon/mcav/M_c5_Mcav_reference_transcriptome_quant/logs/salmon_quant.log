[2022-01-25 00:32:55.628] [jointLog] [info] Counted 5,137,591 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2022-01-25 00:32:55.632] [jointLog] [warning] 5.04822e-05% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 28.
