[2022-01-25 10:04:51.801] [jointLog] [info] Counted 18,955,536 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2022-01-25 10:04:51.806] [jointLog] [warning] 1.43113e-05% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
